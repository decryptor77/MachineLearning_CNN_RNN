This repository contains the implementation of two neural network tasks:



Task 1: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Create a classifier for the CIFAR10 database. You should write your own training code and satisfy the mentioned constraints. 
The performance parameters appear below.
You should try different model architectures (different depths, filter sizes, types of pooling
layers, etc.) and different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) to see how it affects the performance.
Classification Network requirement:
Write a complete training procedure for a classification network on CIFAR10 dataset.
Design and train your network so that it will satisfy the 2 following goals:
a. Final accuracy on the test set should be > 80%
b. The number of trainable parameters (weights) should be less than 50,000.



Task 2: Names generation (RNN)
Train a character-level language model. Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to generate names given their origin country and first letter.
Specify in the report 5 examples of names generated by your model and specify the corresponding inputs.
Think about:
- How should the input data be represented?
- What do you predict?
- When do you predict? At each timestep? At the end of the sequence?
